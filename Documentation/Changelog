CHANGELOG

* 2014/07/21:

    - Revised. Working on MinGW 4.9.0 and MSVC 2014 CTP.
      No changes needed.

* 2013/11/28:

    - Do not handle ESC to quit.

* 2013/09/25:

    - Set warnings to the highest level on both MSVC and MinGW.

    - Include build scripts for MinGW32 and MinGW64.

* 2013/09/24:

    - Do robust error handling and properly release resources.
      Not doing it only saves about 150 bytes.

    - Always call ExitProcess() ourselves.

* 2013/07/09:

    - Use adaptive sleeping.

    - Do *not* draw in WM_PAINT, so much messages produce stuttering.

* 2013/07/08:

    - Double buffering bugfix.

    - Now drawing in WM_PAINT to avoid flickering as much as possible.

    - Fixed GAME_STEP. Default to 13 (about 75 FPS).

* 2013/06/29:

    - First version.
